# Gollum live reload

Live preview when editing Github/Gitlab wiki without messing with your git
history

**Still actively developed**

For now, you can try this by:

- Clone this repo
- `make setup`
- `make serve`
- Go to `http://localhost:4567` to view the rendered wiki home page
- Edit `home.md` and enjoy live reloading.

Also see #1 to learn more about the plan for this project.
